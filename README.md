# Courses

1. Putting up all relevant courses done on various platforms by me .Repo to keep any artifact relevant to certification documentation or Course completion screenshots.

2. Also to use this as a repo to keep exploring GIT in terms of tagging and branching.
   So either on a monthly or quaterly / annual basis create tags / branches.
   To get back to state of courses completed given these tags.
