#### Instance Storage Types ######

1. Instance Store -> Ephemeral ( local storage for that instance )
2. EBS --> Multiple tiers
         i) GPSSD - General purpose USED FOR BOOT
        ii) PIOPS - higher IOPS for databases ( Can be used for BOOT )
       iii) Throughput optimized HDD based ( slightly lower tier )
        iv) Cold HDD
         v) Magnetic ( phased out )

3. EFS ( Network Attached Storage )
    - Managed by AWS for scalability etc

----------------------------------------------------

1. EBS :
     doesnt need to be attached to an instance for existance
     Cannot be attahched to more than one instance at a time
     can be transferred b/w AZ
     AWS volume data is replicated across multiple servers in AZ
     Encryption of data volumes , boot volumes and snapshots possible
     Designed for annual failure Rate ( 0.1 - 0.2 % ) SLA 99.95 %

   i) EBS SSD Use Cases [ BOOT Vols ]
            GP SSD                  |    Provisioned IOPS SSD
     -------------------------------------------------------------
      System boot vols              | IO Intensive
      virtual Desktops              | NoSQL / SQL DBs
      Dev/Test
      MAX Throughput = 160MB/s      |  MAX Throughput = 320 MB/s
      MAX IOPS / vol = 10000        |  Max IOPS/vol = 20000
      MAX IOPS / instance = 65K     |   Max IOPS/instance = 65K
      API Name = gp2                |  io1


   ii) EBS HDD Vol Types [ CANT BE USED AS BOOT VOL ]

          Throughut optimized HDD     |   Cold HDD    
        ------------------------------------------------------------
         Infrequent Data Access       | Throughput oriented for large vols of data
         Streaming                    | lowest storage cost
         Big Data / Logs              |
         Max IOPS / vol = 500         | Max IOPS / vol = 250
         Max Throughput = 500 MB/s    | Max Throughput = 250 MB/s
         API name = st1               | sc1

   
 ---------------- Increasing IOPS Performance ------------------

   Multiple stripped gp2 or standard volumes ( typically RAID 0 Groups for high perf agaisnt RAID 5 )
   Multiple striped PIOPS volumes to have even more higher IOPS.
