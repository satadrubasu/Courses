#### Instance Storage Types ######

1. Instance Store -> Ephemeral ( local storage for that instance )
2. EBS --> Multiple tiers
         i) GPSSD - General purpose USED FOR BOOT
        ii) PIOPS - higher IOPS for databases ( Can be used for BOOT )
       iii) Throughput optimized HDD based ( slightly lower tier )
        iv) Cold HDD
         v) Magnetic ( phased out )

3. EFS ( Network Attached Storage )
    - Managed by AWS for scalability etc

----------------------------------------------------

1. EBS :
     doesnt need to be attached to an instance for existance
     Cannot be attahched to more than one instance at a time
     can be transferred b/w AZ
     AWS volume data is replicated across multiple servers in AZ
     Encryption of data volumes , boot volumes and snapshots possible
     Designed for annual failure Rate ( 0.1 - 0.2 % ) SLA 99.95 %

   i) EBS SSD Use Cases [ BOOT Vols ] [ Throughput is not considered but IOPS is ]
            GP SSD                  |    Provisioned IOPS SSD
     -------------------------------------------------------------
      System boot vols              | IO Intensive
      virtual Desktops              | NoSQL / SQL DBs
      Dev/Test
      MAX Throughput = 160MB/s      |  MAX Throughput = 320 MB/s
      MAX IOPS / vol = 10000        |  Max IOPS/vol = 20000
      MAX IOPS / instance = 65K     |   Max IOPS/instance = 65K
      API Name = gp2                |  io1



   ii) EBS HDD Vol Types [ CANT BE USED AS BOOT VOL ] [ IOPS is NA but throughput is considered ]

          Throughut optimized HDD     |   Cold HDD    
        ------------------------------------------------------------
         Infrequent Data Access       | Throughput oriented for large vols of data
         Streaming                    | lowest storage cost
         Big Data / Logs              |
         Max IOPS / vol = 500         | Max IOPS / vol = 250
         Max Throughput = 500 MB/s    | Max Throughput = 250 MB/s
         API name = st1               | sc1

   
 ---------------- Increasing IOPS Performance ------------------

   Multiple stripped gp2 or standard volumes ( typically RAID 0 Groups for high perf agaisnt RAID 5 )
   Multiple striped PIOPS volumes to have even more higher IOPS.


=======  Creating the Volumes direct or from a snapshot ===========
    ** Volume is made available to instances of the SAME VOLUME.

  I ) GP SSD : Depending on the GiB size chosen , 
        IOPS =    (Baseline of 3 IOPS per GiB with a minimum of 100 IOPS, burstable to 3000 IOPS )
           so uptil 33 GiB by default 100IOPS
           if size is more then IOPS = Size/3 

     Throughput is more applicable to st1 and sc1 family ( HDD )

  II) PIOPS SSD : 
      i) min 4GiB
      ii) IOPS can be configured to max of 50/GiB
           so a storage of 4 GiB can be configure to get a max IOPS of 
           4 X 50(IOPS/GiB) = 200 not more but less is possible
           4 X 20(IOPS/GiB) = 80 IOPS

 III) Throughput optimized HDD ( st1 )
       i)  Min : 500GiB to 16384 GiB 
           IOPS is NA
       ii) Throughput is 40MB/s per 1000GiB or 1 TiB

          Min 500   GiB == Throughput of 40MBps/ TiB * 1/2 Tib = 20MBps
          Max 16384 Gib == Throughput of 40MBps/TiB  * 12  = 500MBps

 IV) COLD Storage HDD ( sc1 )
      Same as Throughput except
         12MBps per TiB Volume space

======  EBS Optimized Instance ==========

  Use Cases where the bottleneck is not the IOPS *
  All volume types will be supported but not all EC2 instance
  IOPS 3000 to 65000
  Max Bandwid  400 to 12000 Mbps
  

  GP-SSD within +-10% of baseline at 99.9 %
  PIOPS within +-10% of perf at 99.9 %

======  EBS SNAPSHOT  ==========( Only available in same region by default /needs manual copy across region if neededs)
  1. Absolute Point in Time Snapshot ( if any DB updates ongoing might miss )
     ( clean way is to shutdown rather than running )
  2. Supports Incremental snapshots ( only changed blocks saved incrementally )
  3. Billed only for changed blocks
      init snapshot it 10 GiB
      next snapshot is changed only 1 GiB
  4. init snapshot has bootstrap info etc ,
      while deleting any snapshot AWS retains right data needed for OS boot etc. 
  5. EBS uses the S3 for storing the snapshots.( S3 as storage service for snapshots )

 
  6. Resizing EBS Volumes , 8GiB snapshot used to create a 30 GiB volume.
     create snapshot -> create a volume of it with increased size --> attach the new volume to the instance
  7. Copy a snapshot to another region ( expansion to another geography )



===========   Amazon Elastic File System ( Petabytes scale ) =============

  1. Petabyte scale of data
  2. EFS are elastic and automatically grow or shrink as we add/remove files
  3. store redundantly across multiple AZs
  4. 1 to 1000s of EC2 instances from multiple AZ can connect concurrently
  5. Use cases : Big Data and analytics / media processing / workflows / Content managaement etc
  6. Default 10 EFS per AWS account per region. ( contact Amazon for more )
  7. On -premise access enabled via direct connect
  8. NFS 4.1 version supported
  9. After creation , we can directly mount these NFS to an EC2 instances.
